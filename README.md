# Expensive-Tracker-web
A web-based expense tracking system developed as part of my Java Web Development course. Built using Spring Boot, it allows users to add, edit, and categorize expenses, view spending summaries, and manage their personal finances efficiently. Features include user authentication, CRUD operations, and responsive UI for a smooth experience.
